CART ALGORITHM
============================================

Create class PJ_Cart_Tree that can be used like in example:

============================================

from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

from homework import PJ_Cart_Tree

import random

 

iris = load_iris()

tree = PJ_Cart_Tree(max_depth=4, acceptable_impurity=0.2 )

tree.fit(iris.data, iris.target)

cl = tree.predict(iris.data[4])

print('Classified as {}'.format(iris.target_names[cl]))

============================================

 

Tree should be no deeper than max_depth parameter, however it

can be more shallow if acceptable_impurity is reached on earlier node.

Impurity should be calculated with Gini equation.

 

Attached notebook contains an example of CART algorithm core 

functions.
